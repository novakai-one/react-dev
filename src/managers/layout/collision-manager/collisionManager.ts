// ── CollisionManager ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Resolves block overlaps after a drop / insert. Pure functions, no state, no
// DOM, no store — WSA is the only caller (it measures heights and feeds them in,
// then persists the result). Geometry is PIXELS (x/y/w/h), the one stored shape.
//
// Single-column model: blocks are full-width, so two blocks collide iff their
// vertical ranges overlap. When real columns land, add an x-range test here.
//
// Flush downward sweep with a cutoff: sort by y, push a block down only if it
// overlaps the one above it (just enough to sit flush), and STOP at the first
// gap — so a rearrange never drifts the whole document.
