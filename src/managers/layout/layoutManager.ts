// ── LayoutManager ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Keeps the document tidy after structural changes: pulls blocks up to fill the
// hole a deleted block left behind. WSA is the only caller (it measures the
// deleted rect and persists the result).
//
// NOTE (layout-layer review pending): _tidy delegates to workspaceLayout helpers
// that read the live DOM (measuredBlockHeight). So this layer is NOT DOM-free as
// originally stated — flagged for the later layout/ boundary review.
//
// Single-column assumption (same as CollisionManager): a full-width delete pulls
// EVERYTHING below up by the vacated height. When x unlocks, restrict the pull
// to blocks whose x-range overlaps the deleted column.

// ── LayoutManager (class) ────────────────────────────────────────────────
// The last helper in WSA's conduit. Receives the shape AFTER BlockManager has
// added or removed a block, tidies the layout (resolve overlaps, re-order the
// file's block ids top-left), and returns the shape for WSA to commit. Triggers
// with no layout consequence return the shape untouched.
//
// It tidies whenever the layout could have changed (a structural key or click).
// Resolving an already-tidy layout is a no-op that returns equal data, so an
// over-eager pass costs nothing — React diffs by reference at commit.
