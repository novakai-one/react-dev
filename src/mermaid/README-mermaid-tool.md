# Flowmap

A spatial diagram tool for dev work — drag-and-drop flowcharts with two-way
Mermaid sync, per-node frontmatter (public-interface cards), type tracing across
the canvas, obstacle-avoiding wires with draggable labels and bends, themes, an
overview minimap, undo/redo, autosave, and SVG/PNG export. Runs entirely in the
browser; no backend.

## Develop

```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # Vite dev server with hot reload
npm run typecheck  # strict tsc, no emit
npm run build      # type-check + production bundle to dist/
npm run preview    # serve the built bundle
```

Open the dev server URL it prints. The app autosaves to `localStorage`, so a
refresh keeps your diagram.

> Why a dev server rather than opening `index.html`? ES modules can't load over
> `file://` (browser CORS). `npm run dev` (or any static server) is required.
> The built `dist/` is fully static and deploys to GitHub Pages as-is.

## Architecture

The model is the single source of truth; the canvas and the Mermaid textarea
both read and write it. Modules are wired through a shared `AppContext` (see
`src/core/context.ts`) rather than importing each other's runtime functions,
which keeps the dependency graph acyclic. `main.ts` is the only module that
knows about all the others — it constructs each one and wires the cross-module
hooks.

### The hook seam

`AppContext.hooks` holds cross-cutting callbacks (`render`, `sync`,
`renderInspector`, `pushHistory`, `toast`, ...). Each module defines its own
behaviour and calls *other* modules' behaviour only through these hooks.
`main.ts` assigns the real implementations after every module is constructed.
This is what lets, say, `nodes.addNode()` trigger a re-render and a history push
without `nodes.ts` importing `render.ts` or `history.ts` directly.

### Frontmatter, type tracing & wires

Each node can carry **frontmatter** (`node.fm`): a `name`, `description`, a list
of `state` vars, and a list of `interfaces`, each with its own `accepts` /
`returns`. List items are stored as raw `"varName: Type"` strings — the part
after the colon is the **type**, which is the cross-reference identity. The value
type plus its helpers (`parseTypeRef`, `nodeUsesType`, `allTypeNames`) live in
`core/frontmatter.ts`; the on-canvas card is built by `buildFmCard` in
`render/render.ts`, and the side-panel editor is `panel/inspector-frontmatter.ts`.

**Type tracing** — single-clicking a type chip on a card sets
`runtime.tracedType`. The next render highlights every node, chip, and wire that
uses that type and dims the rest. Cleared by Esc, an empty-canvas click, or
clicking the same chip again. The wire half (highlight when both endpoints match)
lives in `render/wires.ts`.

**Wires** — `wires.ts` draws each edge; `avoidRouter.ts` routes the non-bent ones
around node footprints (including their frontmatter cards) via the libavoid WASM
router, recomputed on Tidy and after any manual node move/resize/nudge (the
`reroute` hook). An edge may override routing with a manual `bend` point (drag the
midpoint handle on a selected edge) and a manual `labelPos` (drag the label).
Both persist; “Reset route & label” in the edge inspector clears them. See
`SYNTAX_README.md` for the `%% edge … bend/labelpos` metadata lines.

## Persistence keys

- `flowmap.autosave.v1` — the current diagram + camera
- `flowmap.prefs.v1` — theme, font, grid/snap/minimap toggles, default routing
