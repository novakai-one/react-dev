// ── LayoutManager ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Keeps the document tidy after structural changes: pulls blocks up to fill the
// hole a deleted block left behind. Pure functions, no state, no DOM, no store —
// WSA is the only caller (it measures the deleted rect and persists the result).
//
// Single-column assumption (same as CollisionManager): a full-width delete pulls
// EVERYTHING below up by the vacated height. When x unlocks, restrict the pull
// to blocks whose x-range overlaps the deleted column.

/**
 * After a block at `deletedY` (height `deletedH`) is removed, raise every block
 * below it by the vacated height + the gap that sat beneath it, so the doc
 * closes the hole. Results snap back to the grid. Inputs are not mutated.
 *
 * `items` is the REMAINING placements for one file (the deleted one already
 * dropped). Only blocks strictly below the deleted top move.

// added or removed a block, tidies the layout (resolve overlaps, re-order the
// file's block ids top-left), and returns the shape for WSA to commit. Triggers
// with no layout consequence return the shape untouched.
//
// It tidies whenever the layout could have changed (a structural key or click).
// Resolving an already-tidy layout is a no-op that returns equal data, so an
// over-eager pass costs nothing — React diffs by reference at commit.
