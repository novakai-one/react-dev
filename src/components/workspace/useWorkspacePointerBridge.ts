// useWorkspacePointerBridge.ts
//
// Wires document-level mousemove / mouseup into WSA's conduit while WSA is
// mounted.
//
// These two MUST be on document, not the workspace div. If the user releases
// the mouse (or drags) outside the workspace, React's onMouseUp on the div
// never fires — DM would stay isDragging=true, SM would stay _isDragging=true,
// and rubber-band selection would spread across the page. mousedown stays
// React-side on the div (the in-workspace gesture entrypoint).
//
// The bridge does NO logic: it shapes the native event and hands (data, trigger)
// to the single forward callback WSA passes in (its router). Every helper gates
// cheaply when nothing is active.
