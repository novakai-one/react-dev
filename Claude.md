# CLAUDE.md — Novakai

This file governs how you work in this repo. Read it fully before any task.
You are building an AI-first declarative workspace (Notion/Excel/Obsidian replacement).
Stack: React + Vite + TypeScript, Supabase (currently local storage).

---

## 0. THE WORKFLOW GATE (do this every task — no exceptions)

You do NOT start writing implementation code immediately. For ANY task that
creates or changes a module, you first output a **Design Block** and STOP for
my approval:

```
DESIGN BLOCK
- Module: <name>
- Single responsibility (one sentence): <...>
- Public surface (methods/props only): <...>
- Allowed callers (who may import this): <...>
- Shape it receives / returns: <...>
- Rules it could violate + how I avoid them: <...>
```

Only after I reply "approved" do you write code. If a task is trivial
(typo, comment, rename) say "trivial — skipping design block" and proceed.

When you finish ANY code, the task is NOT done until you have run:

```
npm run verify
```

and pasted the output showing it passes. "I believe it passes" is a failure.
Run it. If it fails, fix it and run again. Do not hand back failing work.

## 1. ARCHITECTURE — THE NON-NEGOTIABLES

These are the rules you most often break. They are mechanically enforced by
`npm run verify`. Breaking them fails the build. Treat them as law.

### 1.1 WorkspaceArea is a CONDUIT. It makes ZERO decisions.
WorkspaceArea (and any "Area"/container) only forwards events. It NEVER
decides *what* should happen. It packages a uniform shape and hands it to the
managers, who decide.

❌ FORBIDDEN inside WorkspaceArea / container components:
- calling `.dispatch(`
- calling `getState()` to read app state and branch on it
- any function named like `createBlockAt`, `deleteX`, `placeY` — these are decisions
- `if` statements that choose a domain outcome

✅ REQUIRED pattern — uniform fan-out, no branching on outcome:
```ts
const route = (channel, data, trigger) => {
  let shape = buildShape()              // package only
  shape = bm.receiveMouseEvent(d, trigger, shape)
  shape = sm.receiveMouseEvent(d, trigger, shape)
  shape = dm.receiveMouseEvent(d, trigger, shape)
  shape = lm.receiveMouseEvent(d, trigger, shape)
  commit(shape)                          // hand off, never decide
}
```
The container forwards; the managers decide. If you find yourself making a
choice inside a container, the choice belongs in a manager. Move it.

### 1.2 Uniform shapes everywhere.
Every manager receives and returns the SAME shape type (e.g. `DocShape`).
No bespoke signatures per manager. Same in, same out. This is what makes the
fan-out above legal and bug-resistant.

### 1.3 Coupling: ≤ 1 caller by default.
A module should be imported by exactly one parent. If a module needs more than
one caller, you must STOP and put this in your Design Block:
`SHARED MODULE JUSTIFICATION: <why it must be shared>`.
Enforced by `depcruise`. Adding a second importer without justification fails
the build.

### 1.4 One responsibility per module.
If you cannot state a module's job in ONE sentence with no "and", it is doing
too much. Split it. A helper file/class that gets folded back into the parent
is correct and expected — prefer many small modules over one large one.

## 2. CODE STYLE — ENFORCED

| Rule | Mechanically checked by |
|---|---|
| Functions stay small (1 job) | eslint `max-lines-per-function`, `complexity` |
| Files stay small | eslint `max-lines` |
| No circular deps | `depcruise` `no-circular` |
| Coupling limits (1.3) | `depcruise` custom rules |
| Conduit purity (1.1) | grep gate in `verify` |
| Strict types, no `any` leak | `tsc --noEmit`, eslint `no-explicit-any` |

`npm run verify` runs ALL of the above. If it passes, your code is compliant.
If it fails, read the error — it tells you exactly which rule you broke.

---

## 3. STYLE RULES NOT YET MECHANIZED (still law)

You must follow these even though no tool catches them. I check by reading.

1. **Named intent.** Every data transform/retrieval/creation uses a named
   function whose name states intent. A reader skims top-to-bottom and
   understands without reading line-by-line.
2. **One action set per function**, matching its name. No side errands.
3. **Meaningful variable names.** `file.content.map((block) => ...)`,
   never `(b) =>`.
4. **Encapsulation.** Public surface must match the module's intent. Nothing
   public that shouldn't be.
5. **Comments enhance, not crutch.** If a comment exists only because the code
   is unclear, rename the code instead.
6. **Readability over brevity.** A junior dev must follow it. Keep behaviour
   high-quality; keep the prose simple.
7. **CSS in separate `.css` files**, themed via CSS variables in root.
8. **Types live in `types.ts`.**
9. **State is a last resort.** Do NOT reach for a hook/store/stateful var
   unless it is 100% necessary. Default to an instance variable or plain
   value. If you add state, justify it in one line.

## 4. HOW TO BEHAVE DURING LONG RUNS

- Work in small verifiable chunks. One module → design block → code → verify →
  next. Do not batch five modules before verifying.
- When in doubt about a design choice, STOP and ask in one line. Do not guess
  and build 300 lines on a wrong assumption.
- Never weaken or delete a rule in `npm run verify` to make your code pass.
  If a rule blocks you and you think it's wrong, say so and wait. Editing the
  guardrail to pass is the single worst thing you can do here.
- If you broke a rule, fix the code, not the check.

## 5. PRODUCT CONTEXT (so your designs fit the vision)

- Databases hold all information. UX containers render it.
- Visual/spatial layout IS data (like a DOM tree). Block position is stored.
- User describes outcomes in natural language; the AI builds the workspace UI
  and writes the formulas. Declarative, not formula-authoring by hand.
- Keep modules clean because Stage 2 (multi-user AI agents) and Stage 3
  (integrations) build directly on this core. Sloppy coupling now = breakage
  later.
